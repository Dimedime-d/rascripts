Most of the images I use for badges / icon / boxart for my SM64 sets are here. Mostly consists of cropped images of Mario and some objects.

Some hacks have different textures (ex: Escape from the Jail Definitive Edition changes Mario's colors slightly) or custom objects (see Speed Star Adventure). These images are moved into their own folder.

Also consult these other sources for images:
